Aims v WH

Note*
Run US, CA WHSE Sales and OH first. This report is not dependent on the other, but it’s easier.
File paths are unique to the user and must be updated for each user. All file paths are located at the top of the code.

Description
This report audits and inspects the stock information within AIMS and the self-reporting software for the ON and SV warehouses.
The AIMS information is taken from Data 7 and 13. Stocks are tracked via Style and Color, underscore delimited (style_color). Open order information for data 7 and 13 is also taken to account for available stock. The program compares total stock between the warehouse and AIMS, as well as available (or adjusted stock). Special pass conditions are instituted so that open orders which were sent to the factory, yet not picked will not cause the style to fail.
